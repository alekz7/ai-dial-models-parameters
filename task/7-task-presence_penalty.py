# TODO:
#  Try `presence_penalty` parameter.
#  Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's
#  likelihood to talk about new topics. Higher values == more topic diversity.
#       Range: -2.0 to 2.0
#       Default: 0.0
#  User massage: What is an entropy in LLM's responses?

    print_only_content=True, # Switch to True if you want to see only content from response

)   

# In the final result, we can see that the higher `presence_penalty` (2.0) the more LLM is trying to add topics that
# somehow related to the main topic.
# For Anthropic and Gemini this parameter will be ignored
